## Water Access and Sanitation in Africa: A Case Study

## Project Overview
The primary goal of this case study is to analyze data, identify patterns, and propose informed, data-driven recommendations that governments and stakeholders can implement to effectively improve water access and sanitation in African communities.

## Problem Statement
Access to clean water and proper sanitation remains a critical challenge in many African communities, affecting public health, economic development, and overall quality of life. Despite efforts from governments and international organizations, millions of people still lack reliable water sources and adequate sanitation facilities.

## Aim and Objectives

## Aim: The aim of this analysis is to analyze data, identify patterns, and propose informed, data-driven recommendations that governments and stakeholders can implement to effectively improve water access and sanitation in African communities.

## Objectives:
To provide insights into the availability of water resources in relation to community populations.
To  assess the level of governmental and NGO intervention in water and sanitation projects across different communities.
To provide insights into the satisfaction levels of communities based on water access, sanitation quality, and average distance to the nearest water source in different regions.
To explores the distribution of different water sources and their operational status 


## Exploratory Data Analysis
This was done to answer key business questions.

 Write an SQL query to calculate the average water availability (liters per capita per day) for each country.
   
             SQL QUERY:  

             



Write an SQL query to retrieve details of communities where at least one water point is non-functional.





Please retrieve the information for the top five communities with the highest annual sanitation maintenance costs.

## Insights: Key Findings

Nigeria has the highest average water availability of 58.60 followed closely by Senegal (57.89), Rwanda (56.67), Uganda (56.14), Tanzania (55.21), Ghana (55.18), Ethiopia (54.99), Kenya (54.75), Malawi (54.42), and Zambia with lowest average water availability of 53.62

There are several communities with at least one non-functional water point. The highest number of non-functional water points in the communities is 10.

The top five communities with the highest annual sanitation maintenance cost are Dar Community 329, Eastern community 1658, Eastern community 1021, Western community 1259, and Northern community 638. Among the top 5 communities with the highest annual sanitation maintenance cost , Only Northern community 638, uses latrines as their sanitation facility type, while the rest uses toilets. Also, Dar community 329, Western community 1259, and Eastern community 1658, have water borne disease incident rates of 3.8%, 3.9%, and 6.4% respectively. However, Eastern community 1021 and Northern community 638 have an incident rate of 27% each.

From the findings, Kenya has the highest functional water point of 6,049 and also the highest non-functional water point of 1,116. However, Tanzania has the lowest functional water point 4,354 and the lowest non-functional water point of 879. 

Several Communities have water borne disease incident rate > 20%. Although five out of these communities, Southern Community 380, Northern community 632, Western community 665, Northern community 1133, and Southern Community 1577 have the highest incident rate of 29.9%.

The Region with the highest average distance to water supply is Western  Kenya (5.54) followed closely by Eastern Nigeria (5.48), Northern Malawi (5.41), Central Senegal (5.22), Southern Zambia (5.22), Eastern Rwanda (5.21), Northern Ghana (5.19), Dar es Salaam (5.15), Western Uganda (5.04), Eastern Ethiopia which have the lowest average distance to water supply (5.00)


Several Communities receive both Government and NGO support 

The Eastern Community 932 in Nigeria has the highest population of 14,997


## Recommendations
     
From the insights provided, the following recommendations can help improve water             access, sanitation, and public health outcomes in the affected communities: 

Water Access and Infrastructure:


Invest in water infrastructure, especially in countries with lower water availability (e.g., Zambia).


Repair non-functional water points urgently (notably in Kenya) and develop localized water supply points in regions with long distances to water (e.g., Western Kenya).


Enhance collaboration between government and NGOs.


Sanitation Challenges:
Implement cost-effective sanitation solutions to lower maintenance costs in high-expense communities.


Encourage community-based systems for maintaining sanitation facilities.


Reducing Waterborne Disease Incidents:


Focus on high-risk communities (e.g., Eastern Community 1021 and Northern Community 638) with high disease rates for targeted interventions.


Improve water treatment, hygiene education, and establish early warning systems to manage disease outbreaks.


Equity in Water Distribution:


Expand water supply infrastructure in remote areas with high average distances to water (e.g., Western Kenya and Eastern Nigeria).


Consider mobile water distribution solutions as temporary relief in slow-developing regions.


High-Population Focus:


Allocate more resources to densely populated areas like Eastern Community 932 in Nigeria.


Develop scalable water management plans to prevent shortages and public health crises.
